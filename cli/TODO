* Typical workflows

* Verifying a release
* Uploading a release
* Deployment
* (?) Targeting different deployments
* (?) Managing inner shell components lifecycle (start/stop/restart)

* Pluggable architecture (?)

* Workflow example:

1. Choose target
2. Store credentials (?)
3. Perform operation


* Uploading a release

bosh target /path/to/deployment.MF (or bosh target deployment?)  
bosh release upload /path/to/release_bundle.tar.gz
bosh release verify /path/to/release_bundle.tar.gz

Should our input be a tarball or a manifest?
